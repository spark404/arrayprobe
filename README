Arrayprobe

use this to check the status of a HP (compaq) arraycontroller. Currently it only works with a controller using the cciss driver.



TODO:
Robert says:
you asked me for features...at least I would like to get the product name (from the board id)
drive array size, fault tolerance (RAID etc) and maybe recovery status in % when available
I dunno, whether it's possible to read serial number. But ROM version/backup rom would be also useful for activity with the HP support
